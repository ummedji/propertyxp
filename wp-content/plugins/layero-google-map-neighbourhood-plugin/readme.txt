Thanks for downloading the 'Google Map Neighbourhood Plugin' created by 'www.layero.com'.

This plugin is simple to install and setup.

Installation:
Download the plugin zip file. Go to your wordpress dashboard->Plugins->Add new->Upload and upload the zip file. Once uploaded please activate. 

Setting up:
Once installed you will see a new option 'Map Settings' in your wordpress dashboard. This is where you setup the plugin. 

In the plugin settings page you may change the size of the map in pixels. Note that the parameters need to be given only in number eg:400 instead of 400px.
You can also choose which kind of nearby places are to be displayed.

You can also enable a small link to our site to show your support :)

You will notice a shortcode [map_neighbourhood location="latitude,longitude"] in that page. Add the coordinates (lattitude and longitude) of a place (eg: [map_neighbourhood location="9.997887,76.301891"]). Place it in any page or post you like and our neighborhood map will be displaye there.

Thanks for your support!
